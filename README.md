# PrimeNumber
A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that is only divisible by one and itself. 
Write a function that determines whether or not its parameter is prime, returning True if it is, and False otherwise. Write a main program that reads an integer from the user and displays a message indicating whether or not it is prime. Ensure that the main program will not run if the file containing your solution is imported into another program.
